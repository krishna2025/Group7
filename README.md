Write a program to play the game of Hangman.

Your program will read from a list of words stored in a file. You can make this word list editable manually if you choose to.

The program will choose a random word from the list.

It will then present a user interface for user to type in one character at a time .

If the character is in the word selected then it is displayed in the position.

If the character is not in the selected word, then program beeps and displays the letter H.

Repeat the above two steps. For every incorrect selection display one letter from the word HANGMAN

Game ends when user guesses the word or has made seven failed attempts or the word HANGMAN is displayed
